    <p>Camp Gesher has a lot to offer for rental groups. Our delicious food, great land and water facilities, variety of cabins, vast number of indoor and outdoor meeting locations, our convenient location, and the overwhelming beauty of our grounds make Camp Gesher a great choice for any retreat. On top of all our facilities we recognize that not everyone has the same needs, which is why we are open to any form of customization.</p>
