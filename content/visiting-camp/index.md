We are incredibly lucky to have an amazing alumni community. We know that the experience we create at Gesher has provided our alumni with lifelong friendships and an undying connection to their camp. We want our alumni to feel welcome to visit their old stomping grounds. That is why we provide many opportunities for our alumni to come back to camp and reconnect with the place they loved and grew up in.

- **Family Weekend (June):** Our annual family weekend is a great time to come to camp with your family. You can stay two nights and have your child(ren) participate in scheduled activities throughout the weekend. You will have the opportunity to tour the camp, speak with staff, and get a feel for the camp. This weekend is attended by more than one hundred people; many parents say that this is the best way to know the camp. If you want to participate, please email us at [info@campgesher.com](mailto:info@campgesher.com).
- **Visiting During the Summer:** We would love your family to come and visit during our summers and see firsthand the camp during its operation. In most cases, we’ll be able to host you and your family for a weekend. Please contact us via email or phone to arrange it.
- **Visitor’s Day (July):** Every summer, Camp Gesher holds a visitor’s day between first and second session. Though we will not have activities planned that day, it is still a good time to see the camp, talk to staff, and get a feel for the camp.
- **Alumni Weekend:** Once a summer we have an Alumni Weekend. This is a great opportunity for you to reconnect with old friends, see the camp in action, and experience programming directly created for our alumni visitors. Alumni Weekend fills up quickly so please contact [info@campgesher.com](mailto:info@campgesher.com) for the dates of our annual Alumni Weekend and to reserve your spot.
